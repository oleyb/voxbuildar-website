<br /><br />
I (Brian Oley) know that my users (“you”, “your”) care about how your personal information is used and shared, and I take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about my Privacy Policy.
<br /><br />
All references to the term “you” or “parent” in this Privacy Policy shall include legal guardians, and all references to “children” or “child” shall mean children under 13 years of age.
<br /><br />
By visiting or using the various websites owned and operated by Company, including, without limitation, the https://www.voxbuildar.com website (the “Websites”), using software and mobile apps made by Company (the “Apps”) and/or accessing or using any other functionalities, features, content, applications or services offered from time to time by Company in connection with the Websites or Apps (collectively, the “Services”) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent to my colleciton, use, and sharing of your information in the following ways.
<br /><br />
I. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
<br /><br />
This Privacy Policy covers my treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that I gather when you are accessing, viewing, or using any of my Websites, Apps, and/or Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that I do not own or control, or to individuals that I do not employ or manage.
<br /><br />
I do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any Personal Information to us through the Services. In the event that I learn I have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, I will delete that information as quickly as possibly. If you believe that I might have any information from or about a child under age 13, please contact us at support@voxbuildar.com.
<br /><br />
II. What Information Do I Collect?
<br /><br />
I gather various types of Personal Information from my uses, as explained below. I may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve my Services, to administer and improve my Websites, to allow my users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Websites and Apps, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. I may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as described in this Section and in Section III below). At times, I may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to my partners, subject to any applicable COPPA requirements or restrictions. I collect the following types of information:
<br /><br />
A. Information You Provide to Us
<br /><br />
I may collect Personal Information from you when you visit any of my Websites, register for or subscribe to any Services, contact us with questions or concerns, and/or otherwise interact with the Services. For example, when you purchase a Service on any of my Websites, I may collect your name, email address, phone number, address, and payment card information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of my features.
<br /><br />
B. Information Collected Automatically
<br /><br />
Whenever you interact with any of my Websites, I automatically receive and record information on my server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers I transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in my Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of my Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
<br /><br />
When you interact with any of my Apps, I automatically receive and record information including your device model and name, operating system and version, and activity on the Apps. I may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how various features of the Apps are used and information about the number, frequency, and length of each session.
<br /><br />
C. E-mail and Other Communications
<br /><br />
I may contact you, by email or other means; for example, I may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with your about your use of any of the Websites. Also, I may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve my service.
<br /><br />
III. Will I Share Any of the Personal Information I Receive?
<br /><br />
I share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.
<br /><br />
A. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites I Do Not Control
<br /><br />
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through a Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and I will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that is related to such transaction or service. I have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to enter into such transaction or to receive such service, please review the applicable third party websites’ policies.
<br /><br />
B. Agents
<br /><br />
I employ other companies and people to perform tasks on my behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you, for example, processing credit card payments and delivering product. Unless I tell you differently, my agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information I share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
<br /><br />
C. Business Transfers
<br /><br />
I may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if I (or substantially all of my assets) are acquired, or if I go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
<br /><br />
D. Protection of Company and Others
<br /><br />
I reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information I reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply my conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, my employees, my users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<br /><br />
E. With Your Consent
<br /><br />
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
<br /><br />
IV. Is Personal Information About Me Secure?
<br /><br />
I endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information I hold in my records, but I cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
<br /><br />
The Websites may contain links to other sites. I are not responsible about the privacy policy and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.
<br /><br />
V. What Personal Information Can I Access?
<br /><br />
You may request the correction, updating, or deletion of your Personal Information on my Websites by emailing us at support@voxbuildar.com. I will respond to all such requests within 30 days. If you request that your Personal Information be deleted from my records, there may be a brief delay in my processing request, I will verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your Personal Information be deleted, I reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Websites and/or Services.
<br /><br />
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which I share with my affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to support@voxbuildar.com.
<br /><br />
VI. What Choices Do I Have?
<br /><br />
You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us to take advantage of some my special features.
<br /><br />
VII. Changes to this Privacy Policy
<br /><br />
I may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information I collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If I make changes in the way I use Personal Information, I will notify you by posting an announcement on my Website or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.
<br /><br />
